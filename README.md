 These are only some trivial codes. Just recorde here.

 * <FRB_cl_late.py> calculates the power spectrum for FRB DM in late time (with Limber approximation), at least later than reionzation epoch. We only consider the IGM and host parts of DM, because they are contruibute to the number density of electrons at a cosmological distance. Ref: [Reconstruction of baryon fraction in intergalactic medium through dispersion measurements of fast radio bursts](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.4576D/abstract).

 * <cl_bubble> calculates the bubble power spectrum during the reionzation epoch. It includes one-bubble $P_{XX}^{1b} and two-bubble power spetrum $P_{XX}^{2b}$ and cross power spectrum $P_{Xm}$. We follow formulas as [Reconstruction of reionization history through dispersion measurements of fast radio bursts](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...05..050D/abstract).
